Playing NES games with PS/2 keyboard

Using TI Tiva LaunchPad Board. Use Energia IDE to compile code. I choose random pins. So you can change to other. But for JoyPad DATA pin and PS/2 CLK and DATA pins you need logic level converter. You can buy cheep I2C converter from eBay. It will fit perfectly for this project. Code written for PAL NES console. But few changes and you can support NTSC console.
